# Arduino Volume Knob

An Arduino compatible board with an Atmega32u4 that has Human Interface Device capability is required.
Code for either a digital rotary encoder or an analog potentiometer is provided.

The case is designed to work with a metal volume knob from an old radio I had lying around.
